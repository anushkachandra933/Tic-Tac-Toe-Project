# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple yet elegant Tic-Tac-Toe game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project focuses on clean UI, responsive layout, and intuitive game logic—perfect for casual play or showcasing your frontend skills.

## 🚀 Features

- Two-player turn-based gameplay (X vs O)
- Win detection using predefined patterns
- Draw detection when all boxes are filled
- Reset and New Game buttons for replayability
- Dynamic styling for player moves
- Responsive design using `vmin` units

## 🧠 How It Works

- The game board is a 3×3 grid of buttons.
- Players alternate turns, starting with "X".
- After each move, the game checks for a win or draw.
- If a win is detected, a congratulatory message is shown.
- If all boxes are filled without a winner, it's a draw.
- Players can reset or start a new game anytime.
